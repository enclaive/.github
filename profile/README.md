<summary>Motivation </summary>
<br>
Let's be frank. Open-source software is awesome! So many projects have been created in the last decades that shaped the entire software industry. Even enterprises have realized the value and importance of open-source software. Instead of reinventing the wheel and writing proprietary software from scratch, enterprises deploy open-source software to build business applications. The enterprise-wide acceptance of open-source software has helped many community projects to establish a sustainable business model around, paving the ground to make a living out of a passionate idea. 
<br></br>
Open-source projects employ a variety of business models to solve the challenge of how to make money providing software that is by definition licensed free of charge. Each of these business strategies rests on the premise that users of open-source technologies are willing to purchase additional software features under proprietary licenses, or purchase other services or elements of value that complement the open-source software that is core to the business. This additional value can be, but not limited to, enterprise-grade features and up-time guarantees (often via a service-level agreement) to satisfy business or compliance requirements, performance and efficiency gains by features not yet available in the open source version, legal protection (e.g., indemnification from copyright or patent infringement), or professional support/training/consulting that are typical of proprietary software applications. 
<br></br>
In recent years we see a growing interest for <b>managed services</b>. Enterprises use the software without the burden of being in charge of the hosting infrastracture and its availability, as well as the updatability and security of the software. Although enterprises have numerous benefits from managed offerings, they are hesistant! The key reason is lack of control. Granting a third party the permission to manage software applications, raises a lot of trust, security, privacy and compliance issues what does not go along with enterprise policies. In some cases, in which IT resources are scarce, managed services are desperately desired, however they are ruled out strictly due to the named reasons. Software companies are thus left with the provisioning of first, second and third level support and are taken the ability to scale.

<summary>Mission </summary>
<br>
Our mission is to make open-source software deployable everywhere by everyone. By everyone we mean any individual, any business or any industry. By everywhere we mean any execution platform, be it private or be it public. 
We envision the further democratization of open-source software. The notion of free choice behind open-source software extends to free deployment. No one should be hampered from using open-source software anywhere.
