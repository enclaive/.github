<summary>Motivation </summary>
<br>
Let's be frank. Open-source software is awesome! So many projects have been created the last decades that shaped the software industry. Even enterprises have realized the value and importance of open-source software for business. Instead of reinventing the wheel and writing proprietary software from scratch, enterprises deploy open-source software to build the business applications. The enterprise-wide acceptance of open-source software has helped many community projects to build a sustainable business model around their project, paving the ground to make a living out of a passionate idea. 
<br></br>
Open-source projects employ a variety of business models to solve the challenge of how to make money providing software that is by definition licensed free of charge. Each of these business strategies rests on the premise that users of open-source technologies are willing to purchase additional software features under proprietary licenses, or purchase other services or elements of value that complement the open-source software that is core to the business. This additional value can be, but not limited to, enterprise-grade features and up-time guarantees (often via a service-level agreement) to satisfy business or compliance requirements, performance and efficiency gains by features not yet available in the open source version, legal protection (e.g., indemnification from copyright or patent infringement), or professional support/training/consulting that are typical of proprietary software applications.
<br></br>
In recent years we see a growing interest for <b>managed services</b>. Enterprises use the software without the burden of being in charge of the hosting infrastractures, its availability, as well as the updatability and security of the software. In other words, it's about serving the software functionality on a silver plate. Although enterprises clearly benefit from the premium offering, they are hesistant! The key reason is lack of control. Granting a third party the permission to manage a software applications, raises a lot of trust, security, privacy and compliance issues what does not go along with enterprise policies. In some cases, like in the governmental and public sector managed services are desperately desired, but strictly ruled out due to the named reasoned. Software companies are thus left with the provisioning of first, second and third level support which limits the ability to scale the business.
